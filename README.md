This simple viewer connects to the AAG Cloudwatcher application (https://shop.lunaticoastro.com/product/aag-cloudwatcher-cloud-detector/) and displays Sky Temperature, Dew Temperature, Ambient Temperature and Relative Humidity.

A graph function allows to follow changes in the Sky Temperature. Right-clicking on the graph window allows setting the vertical scale of the sky temperature graph.
